# The Code Fixer - Homebrew Tap

This Homebrew tap hosts command-line tools (CLIs) developed by Louiss0 for various purposes.  You can use these tools to automate tasks, improve your workflow, or enhance your development environment.

## How do I install these formulae?

First, tap this repository:

```
brew tap louiss0/the-code-fixer-23
```

Then, install the desired formula:

```
brew install louiss0/the-code-fixer-23/<formula>
```

For example, to install a CLI named `example-cli`, you would run:

```
brew install louiss0/the-code-fixer-23/example-cli
```

Alternatively, you can install the tap and then install the formula:

```
brew tap louiss0/the-code-fixer-23
brew install <formula>
```

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "louiss0/the-code-fixer-23"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Casks

This tap can also host casks for installing macOS applications. To install a cask, use the following command:

```
brew install --cask <cask-name>
```

For example, to install a cask named `example-app`, you would run:

```
brew install --cask example-app
```

Note: Casks are different from formulae. Formulae install command-line tools, while casks install macOS applications and other GUI-based software.

## Available Formulae and Casks

This tap provides both command-line tools (formulae) and macOS applications (casks).

*   `javascript-package-delegator-formula`: Installs the `javascript-package-delegator` command-line tool.
*   `javascript-package-delegator`: Installs the `javascript-package-delegator` application as a cask.

*(This section will list the available formulae with brief descriptions.  This will need to be updated manually as you add new CLIs.)*

*   `the-code-fixer-23`: *(Provide a brief description of what this CLI does)*
